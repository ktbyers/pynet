"""Read in the "show_ip_int_brief.txt" file into your program using the
.readlines() method.

Obtain the list entry associated with the FastEthernet4 interface. You can
just hard-code the index at this point since we haven't covered for-loops
or regular expressions:

Use the string .split() method to obtain both the IP address and the
corresponding interface associated with the IP.

Create a two element tuple from the result (intf_name, ip_address).

Print that tuple to the screen.

Use pylint on this script. Get the warnings/errors to zero. You might need
to 'pip install pylint' on your computer (should be able to type this from
the shell prompt). Alternatively, you can type:

  'python -m pip install pylint'.
