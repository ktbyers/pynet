"""Read in the "show_arp.txt" file using the readlines() method. Use a list slice to
remove the header line.

Use pretty print to print out the resulting list to the screen, syntax is:
----
from pprint import pprint
pprint(some_var)
----

Create a new list slice that is only the first three ARP entries.

Use the .join() method to join these first three arp entries back together as a single string
using the newline character ('\n') as the separator.

Write this string containing the three ARP entries out to a file named "arp_entries.txt".
